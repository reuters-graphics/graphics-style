## AMERS spot news routine


A balanced diet of graphics includes quick bites on the news as well as more indulgent meals from deeper enterprise and investigation.

The AMERS spot news routine is designed to make sure the quick bites happen and that we have a dedicated space to cover breaking news.

### Goals of the routine

- Create a mechanism that helps us better cover breaking news
- Build muscle memory for identifying timely graphics and for using graphics tools on deadline
- Encourage more enterprise data reporting that rises through the Simon Scarr Ladder of Graphics Abstraction™
- Publish quick-turn graphics for BOTH media clients and dot com readers

### What's a spot graphic?

Spot graphics are mostly defined by their limited scope. In general, they are graphics we can turn in a day.

A spot graphic is:

- [a chart and a headline](https://graphics.reuters.com/AIRBNB-RESULTS/nmovazbglpa/)
- [a chart, a headline and a graf](https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/USA-STATES/xegpbwqzkvq/index.html) ⭐
- [a story that rises through the ladder of abstraction on a timely story](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/02/19/climate/texas-storm-power-generation-charts.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur)

### The quota

AMERS desk staff should produce one spot graphic every week.

#### Sources for spot graphics

The two primary sources for spot graphics are the same as most other graphics. Newsroom pitches and our own enterprise.

The easiest spot graphics are sourced from data that's **already public** and, usually, **already in a structured format**.

The best ideas for spot graphics come from **reading the news** and asking questions of headlines that graphics can answer.

### How we'll support spot news

The goal of spot news is that everyone on the desk can pitch, execute and publish spots on their own. The conversation around identifying spot news potentials, though, is a shared responsibility across the team. We'll devote 10 mins at the top of every standup to a graphics discussion of the news. The purpose of that discussion should always be identifying spot graphics.

We'll create a column in Trello to warehouse spot graphics pitches we aren't moving on immediately. At the end of every week, we'll clear out that list of any pitches that have gone stale.

Jon and Chris will help negotiate deadlines on spot news and, importantly, help you walk away from ideas that don't pan out.
