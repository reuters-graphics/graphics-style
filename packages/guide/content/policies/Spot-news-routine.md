## AMERS spot news routine


A balanced diet of graphics includes quick bites on the news as well as more indulgent meals from deeper enterprise and investigation.

The AMERS spot news routine is designed to make sure the quick bites happen and that we have a dedicated mechanism we can use to cover breaking news.

### Goals of the routine

- Help us better cover breaking news
- Build muscle memory for identifying timely graphics and for using graphics tools and techniques on deadline
- Encourage more enterprise data reporting that rises through the Simon Scarr Ladder of Graphics Abstraction™
- Publish quick-turn graphics for BOTH media clients and dot com readers

### What's a spot graphic?

Spot graphics are mostly defined by their limited scope. In general, they are graphics we can turn in a day.

A spot graphic is:

- [a chart and a headline](https://graphics.reuters.com/AIRBNB-RESULTS/nmovazbglpa/)
- [a chart, a headline and a graf](https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/USA-STATES/xegpbwqzkvq/index.html) ⭐
- [a story that rises through the ladder of abstraction on a timely topic](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/02/19/climate/texas-storm-power-generation-charts.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur)

The eventual goal is for the graphics desk to publish more short stories with timely graphics to both dot com readers (i.e., a graphics.reuters.com page) AND as an embed to media clients through Connect. Early days, a spot news graphic can also just publish to media clients.

### The quota

AMERS desk staff should produce one spot graphic every week. Once spot news becomes a regular habit on the desk, we may adjust or even remove this quota, but for at least 2 months, the quota is there to force us to pitch timelier graphics.

#### Sources for spot graphics

The two primary sources for spot graphics are the same as most other graphics: Newsroom pitches and our own enterprise ideas.

The easiest spot graphics are sourced from data that's **already public** and, usually, **already in a structured format**.

The best ideas for spot graphics usually come from **reading the news** and asking questions of headlines that graphics can answer.

### How we'll support spot news

The goal of spot news is that everyone on the desk can pitch, execute and publish spots on their own. The conversation around identifying spot news potentials, though, is a shared responsibility across the team. We'll devote 10 mins at the top of every standup to a graphics discussion of the news. The purpose of that discussion should always be identifying spot graphics.

We'll create a column in Trello to warehouse spot graphics pitches we aren't moving on immediately. At the end of every week, we'll clear out that list of any pitches that have gone stale.

Jon and Chris will help negotiate deadlines and the scope of spot news and, importantly, help you walk away from ideas that don't pan out.

### Pitching spot news

Spot news should always be pitched within the limit of what we can do in a day and are usually pitched with a dataset in hand.

We want many spot graphics to turn into larger stories. When they do, Jon will approve an expansion of the pitch.
