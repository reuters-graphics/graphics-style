## Export crisp and optimised flat-graphics from Adobe Illustrator

Flat graphics are a common part of our workflow for breaking news as well as for moving assets to clients. These are used both in print and digital across platforms, including image-embeds in Reuters text stories. Hence it is important to export crisp and optimised flat graphics from Illustrator.

### 📂 Folder structure
This is a generic folder structure for flat graphics, which is zipped and uploaded to RNGS. It is important to keep the zippack size as small as possible and definitely below 100mb.
```
+- [SLUG-AS-FOLDERNAME]
  +- EPS
    +- [SLUG-AS-FILENAME].eps
    +- [SLUG-AS-FILENAME].jpg/png
  +- IMG
    +- [SLUG-AS-FILENAME].jpg/png
```
